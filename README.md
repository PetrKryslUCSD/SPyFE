# SPyFE (C) 2017-2020, Petr Krysl

SPyFE stands for "Simple Python Finite Element" environment.
Plain Python is used throughout (with some `numpy` thrown in).
Installation is therefore very easy. The drawback  is evidently the speed:
the package is only for toy models (even though it is possible to run 
simulations with millions of degrees of freedom, if one is willing to wait a bit).

## News

- 02/05/2020: The repository is being updated to Python 3.7.6.

## Examples

I typically use Spyder to run the examples. Simply open the example file
in the IDE and click on the run button.
